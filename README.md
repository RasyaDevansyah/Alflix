# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RasyaDevansyah/Alflix
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
### Running the Development Server
To start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR), run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application by opening http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Building for Production
To build the project for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the dist directory.

### Previewing the Production Build
To preview the production build locally, run:
```bash
npm run preview
```
This will serve the production build locally, typically at http://localhost:4173.
