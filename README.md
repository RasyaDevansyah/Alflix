# React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RasyaDevansyah/Alflix
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

### Building for Production
To build the project for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the dist directory.
